            What is coding ? well coding basically is the process of using a programming language <br>
            to instuct a computer on what to do or simply follow the command given to it. Its <br>
            about creating possible lines of code which might just happen to enable computers to<br>
            do a whole new thing depending on the attributes and specifications of code programmed<br>

            If you want to start learning code you first got to decide what is it that i want to do<br>
            After identifing that piece , find a programming language that will enable you to carry <br>
            out what you desire and connect that piece. That puts you in a position to learn all about<br>
            the fundamentals . Third DO IT and all pieces will be together and in a postion to happen.<br>

            Its cool to start by visiting a few videos on youtube to learn or online documentation that <br>
            will help you in becoming a great programmer. Sometimes if you find a book go ahead and read <br>
            it to help you get a wide view on it. You can watch tutorials online and practice everytime<br>
            to conceptualize it and achieve your goal and with time become a professional at it and while<br>
            your at it teach others.
