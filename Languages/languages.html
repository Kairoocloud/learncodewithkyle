    <h1>Programming Languges</h1>
    <p class="paragraphs2">A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output.<br>
         Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. </p>
    
    <p class="paragraphs2">
        Why need of programming language? ... The programing language enables us to write efficient programs<br>
         and develop online solutions such as- mobile applications, web applications, and games, etc. Programming is used to automate, maintain,<br>
          assemble, measure and interpret the processing of the data and information.

    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs2">
        Programming is important in our daily life to enhance and increase the power of computers and the internet.<br>
         Programming is important for speeding up the input and output processes in a machine. Programming is important to automate,<br>
          collect, manage, calculate, analyze the processing of data and information accurately.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs2">
        Most coding training doesn't cover these things, so it's no wonder people get frustrated and give up.<br>
         The reason you might think it's 'hard' is because you're not getting results. But you must understand that in order to develop your coding skills,<br>
          you can't just mindlessly follow instructions from a tutorial.
